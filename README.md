# Cardiac Connection

## Cross-platform mobile application connecting with FitBit Ionic

The app allows the FitBit Ionic to record heart rates of the user while he/she is looking through profiles. If heart rates are higher than normal, they will "like" that person's profile. If the users heart rates remained constant throughout, then the person will choose to "skip" over the person's profile.

basically tinder when your heart rate goes up it swipes right

Built with Cordova and node.
